## About the Book
The Databricks Lakehouse is groundbreaking technology that simplifies data storage, processing, and analysis. This cookbook offers a clear and practical guide to building and optimizing your Lakehouse to make data-driven decisions and drive impactful results.

This definitive guide walks you through the entire Lakehouse journey, from setting up your environment, and connecting to storage, to creating Delta tables, building data models, and ingesting and transforming data. We start off by discussing how to ingest data to Bronze, then refine it to produce Silver. Next, we discuss how to create Gold tables and various data modeling techniques often performed in the Gold layer. You will learn how to leverage Spark SQL and PySpark for efficient data manipulation, apply Delta Live Tables for real-time data processing, and implement Machine Learning and Data Science workflows with MLflow, Feature Store, and AutoML.
